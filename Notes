## Note: Bitarray representation of a node.

For parent node: The representation has 2*n_tips representing two subsplits. bit_arr[:n_tips], bit_arr[n_tips:]
For child subsplit: the bitarray only has n_tips number of bit, which is generally enough.

## Note: Models for VBPI

For the VBPI, two models are essential:

Tree Model: SBN => keep track for root-splits and subsplits. Iteratively, update these during the learning algorithm.
            Also used for sampling trees (n_particles) where used to calculate VIMCO estimator for variance reduction.
            root-splits and  sub splits are converted to tensor parameters to be used in back-propagation.
            The updated parameters are used iteratively.

Branch-model: GNN or BaseModel which predict mu and sigma for branch length distribution.
              Use parameterization trick for gradient calculation.
